**Bastion Server Platform** is an open-source, Windows-based server management system designed for game server hosting. Built with C# and .NET Framework, Bastion provides a sleek web-based panel and powerful backend to manage, start, stop, and monitor game servers like Minecraft, CS:GO, and more — all with a Windows-native approach.

> Think of it like Pterodactyl Panel, but for Windows and written in C#.
